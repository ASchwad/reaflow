# Basics

## Your First Diagram
Let's build our first diagram by defining some `nodes` and `edges`.
Nodes are the blocks and edges are the relationships between the blocks.

The data shapes require one property of `id` but you can pass `text`
or `icon` to them to show some sort of indication what it represents.
The `id` property can be any `string` but for demonstration purposes
we are going to use some basic strings.

```js
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1',
    text: '1'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    text: '2'
  }
];

const edges = [
  {
    id: '1-2',
    from: '1',
    to: '2'
  }
];
```

These shapes above will create two elements `1` and `2` and create
a relationship between them. Once we have this defined, we can simply
pass these properties to the `Canvas` and it will do the rest!

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Canvas } from 'reaflow';

export const MyDiagram = () => (
  <Canvas
    nodes={nodes}
    edges={edges}
  />
)
```

Below is an example of what this basic example will render.

<div style={{ height: 500, width: 700, position: 'relative', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <Story id="demos-basic--simple" />
</div>
